# Network Infrastructure
Keeping Your Network Connected and Secured 24/7

## Industry-Leading Network Performance
We conduct intensive test our Network Capabilities and Wi-Fi Access Points in environments that have up to 1,500 hosts and devices running on a single wireless access point, to ensure we deliver the best in real-world performance.

## High Reliability & Topological Troubleshooting
Our advanced tools allow us to build and maintain a “Network Topology Diagram” automatically that identifies all devices on your network and where they’re connected – making network troubleshooting a breeze.

## Complete Wi-Fi Coverage
Our Wi-Fi heatmap tool allow us to calculate and visualise expected Wi-Fi signal strengths according to your floorplan or room layout, making sure your Wi-Fi Access Points are installed in the most optimal locations in your space.

## Engage Your Customers
Get your customers to “Check-In” on social media when they access your Guest Wi-Fi on your premises, allowing you to reach out to wider customer audience.

## Enhanced Network Security
Security is our priority. Increase the security of your network with these advanced capabilities.

1. Network Segregation
   * Keep your Guest’s Devices away from your Internal Network – separating your corporate data, while making your guests happy with high speed Internet Access.
2. Rogue AP Detection
   * Get alerted automatically should malicious users try to spoof your wireless network.
3. GeoIP Filtering
   * Filter out network traffic from historically high-risk countries for better security.
4. Firewall
   * Block out intruders and unwanted users from entering your network.
5. Intrusion Prevention System / Intrusion Detection System
   * Automatically detect, alert and block any malicious, network-based attacks.
6. Deep Packet Inspection
   * Inspect the network packets to stop users from accessing dangerous websites that could weaken your network security.
