Recover Painlessly from The Unexpected

## Disaster Recovery in One-Click
Enable Disaster Recovery with any existing Nexraid Backup Cloud deployment at a flip of a switch.

## Instant Offsite Failover
Get back-to-business in mere minutes, even if you experience a site outage, as we seamlessly switch your production workload to always-ready virtual machines in the Cloud.

## Encrypted Backup Support
Encrypt your backups for added security, while still being able to perform failover operations via a secure key vault that stored passwords for automated Disaster Recovery operations.

## Automated Testing
Don’t get caught with broken backups in a disaster, as we constantly verify the integrity of your Disaster Recovery plans – via executing runbooks in test-mode via the web console, which are isolated and protected from your production network.

## VPN-less Deployment
Take your Recovery Testing and Disaster Recovery plans a step faster and better, with the new “Cloud-only” Deployment options for your backups.

## RPO and RTO Tracking
Define Recovery Point and Recovery Time Thresholds for the servers and keep your compliance on your Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) in real-time via Web Console.
