# Threat Hunting
Stop Digital Threats, Investigate Attacks and Remedy Weaknesses

## Award Winning Methodology
Our methodology and processes have rated at the top of independent tests and analytic reports for total endpoint protection.

## Synchronized Security
Our revolutionary Security Heartbeat ensures all our security products are working together to find advanced threats faster and minimize attack surface and user impact.

## Power by Artificial Intelligence
Our security engine uses deep learning neural network, an advanced form of machine learning that detects both known and unknown malware without relying on signatures. It makes our security products smarter, more scalable, and higher-performing than endpoint security solutions that use traditional machine learning or signature-based detection alone.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR shows you where the attack enters your organization and what files and program it has accessed, forming a huge network for threat analysis and digital forensic. You can now easily understand the scope and impact of security incidents.

## Managed Threat Response (MTR)
With Nexraid MTR, your organization is backed by an elite team of threat hunters and response experts inside our Security Operation Centre (SOC) who take targeted actions on your behalf to neutralize even the most sophisticated threats 24/7/365.
