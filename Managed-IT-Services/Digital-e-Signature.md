# Digital e-Signature
Notarized Digital Signatures Made Simple

## Blockchain-Powered Notarization
Powered by Ethereum, the distributed nature of Blockchain provides strong file authenticity, and mitigates the risk of fraud and tampering – so you know your data is always authentic.

## e-Signatures and Digital Contracts
Gone are the days where you had to maintain paper fragile records, instead draw up contracts and invite other parties to e-sign and certify your documents digitally for a safer, paperless experience.

## Timestamp Proofing and Verification
Be able to publicly verify the authenticity of all electronically signed documents, with Timestamp Proofing generated when any and all parties e-sign.

## Verify Easily – Anytime, Anywhere
After the signed document or file is notarized, you can verify it from any device at any time directly from our web interface or manually through the blockchain ledger.
