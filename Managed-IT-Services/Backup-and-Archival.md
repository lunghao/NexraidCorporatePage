# Backup and Archival
Keeping Valuable Data Safe and Backups Protected

## Backup Any Device
We support the backup of all major server, endpoint, and mobile operating systems; including hypervisors, database engines and even Public Clouds.

## Store Anywhere
You have the freedom to choose where your backups are stored, from on-device or local server storage, to your own Public Cloud provider or our own secured cloud solution.

## Powered by AnyData Engine
Fuelled by over 100 patents, our AnyData Engine is a set of deep and powerful New Generation Data Protection technologies that capture, store, recover, control and access any data you want protected in virtual, physical, mobile and cloud environments.

## Notarized Backups with Blockchain Integration
Ensure the file authenticity of your backups and archives, through our specialist use of Ethereum (a blockchain-based smart contract platform), that notarizes the integrity of your backups.

## Active Protection
Prevent system downtime by eliminating up to 99.99% of ransomware with a uniquely proactive, AI-based protection system â€“ including the automatic restoration of any impacted files impacted before attack deflection.

## Instant Restore
Minimise recovery times significantly by spinning up any physical or virtual Windows or Linux system locally, to directly initiate the backup storage on your existing Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware vSphere ESXi host.
