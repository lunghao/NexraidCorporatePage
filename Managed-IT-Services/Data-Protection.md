# Data Protection
Securing Your Data for Peace of Mind

## Data Sensitivity Classification
Automatically identify, classify, label, and secure files based on sensitivity of the data within, by user identity, or by system recommendation.

## One-Click Protection
Get rid of old-password file protections and use modern data classification and protection controls that are directly integrated into Microsoft Office other common third-party applications to secure the data you’re working on with one-click.

## File-Level Encryption
Encrypt all your files with enterprise-grade “SHA-256” encryption at the file level – allowing you to revoke individual file access, even if the file has left your organisation’s network and devices.

## Enforce “Do Not Forward”
While simple sounding, being able to stop your email recipients from forwarding sensitive emails and the data to unauthorised personnel, is an important step in keeping your information secure.
