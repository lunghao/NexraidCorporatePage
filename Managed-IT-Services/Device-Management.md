Software and Hardware Management Made Simple

## Remote Device Monitoring
Proactively monitor your Windows, macOS, and Linux devices to provide early issue detection and ready patches – allowing you to stay one step ahead of costly downtimes and tragic data loss.

## Device Refresh Recommendations
We'll constantly analyse and monitor your performance bottlenecks – recommending internal swaps or new device replacement according to your users' needs, while keeping an eye on your budget.

## Asset Management
Never worry about compliance or auditing again, as we keep a constant up-to-date overview of all your deployed hardware and software.

## Patch Management
We immediately detect and patch outdated or vulnerable software and operating systems to keep all your IT systems up-to-date – through automatically pre-tested updates that are safe, even for third-party applications.
