## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is the difference between IT consulting, managed IT services and professional IT services?
Though there are a lot of similarities between the three. The goal is vastly different.

IT consulting focus on cost effectiveness and strategy planning. We identify gaps and prioritise the type of service based on your budget assigned.

Managed IT services removes all the complexity of IT. You pay a monthly fee in exchange for an IT service with a financially backed service level agreement. This usually includes a contract range from 1 to 3 years just like utility contracts. We will manage all the hardware and software if requirement.

Professional IT services are for customer who already knows what they are looking for and has already done their research on pros and cons of the selected solution. However, they lack the expertise or resources to deploy or maintain the solution internally. Hence, they are looking to outsource the project on one off basis.


### How do I know if I need IT consulting, managed IT services or traditional IT services?

   * No -> IT Consulting
   * Yes
      * Do you have enough resources to maintain the solution?
         * Yes -> professional IT services
         * No -> managed IT services


### Is our Digital Transformation consulting right for you?
We’re upfront that our approach may not be right for everyone – for example, not all businesses and organizations see IT as a necessary requirement. Furthermore, consulting may be unnecessary for small companies that do not need extensive role-based access controls, auditing, and monitoring capabilities – and it can be especially intimidating if there are no dedicated IT staff. We may also decline support for hard requirements that need legacy device/software management that come without the original manufacturer’s support.

Nonetheless, our proposals work best when businesses already have an IT budget in mind, as this allows us to best advise you on how to achieve the best cost-effective ratio for your digital transformation strategy.

We also strongly recommend that businesses who wish to automate their business process using technology have long-term sight. This means, deciding to set aside a fixed budget and allocate resources annually to see growth over the next few years – alongside having a dedicated IT Staff member who can assist you to drive your digital transformation and provide internal support with our guidance.

### How much budget do I need to conduct Digital Transformation?
We usually calculate budget based on IT spending per employee. This cost includes your hardware (such as laptop, handphone, printer, smart card, network equipment, servers etc), software (antivirus, Photoshop, backup software etc.) and services (internet service, email hosting, CRM solution, LOB app development, IT maintenance contracts, IT consulting etc) divided by your total number of employees.

Our average customer IT spending usually range between US$500 to US$2,500 per employee per month. Most of them started from US$100 and slowly increase as their business grows and operation cost decreases from IT automation.

### How long does a Digital Transformation typically take?
Our Digital Transformation proposals typically range from 3 to 5 years, with each project deployment averaging at about 6 to 12 weeks.

As technology progresses every day, actual deployments may defer from the original proposal, whenever we are able to find something even more cost-effective for you. To mitigate this, we provide annual reviews to ensure that your Digital Transformation plan is kept up to date still being flexibility for ever-evolving changes.

### How much can I expect my Digital Transformation to cost?
We offer multi-year, proposal-based bids, that comprise multiple projects and milestones in between.

We typically suggest a “Pay-Per-Milestone” billing model, that allows us to come to agreements ahead of time on deliverables to better manage expectations across your organisation. That way, it’s easier to quantify the number of man-hours required for the start of each milestone and subsequent invoice, thus, preventing bill-shock from any excess hours or additional services, as subject to our stipulated Master Services Agreement.

### Do you offer onsite engagements?
Most of our services are provided on a remote basis. We do arrange for onsite meetings and deployments when necessary but keep them to a minimum as part of streamlining our process and also keeping your consultation costs low.

### Do you offer after hours support and maintenance?
Yes, of course! In fact, we recommend conducting support and maintenance after typical office hours, which reduces the impact on users, while allowing for the flexibility to conduct more extensive diagnosis that would otherwise be disruptive during normal operational hours.

### What regions do you serve?
While we are headquartered in Singapore, our services and teams extend to organisations worldwide. To date, we've worked with businesses from the US, UK, Greater China Regions, and ASEAN, alongside our local clientele.

### How do I start, and what can I expect?
Everything starts with an initial consultation, where we’ll arrange a time to meet and get-to-know you – where we zoom into your current Digital Transformation challenges. If all’s well, we’ll proceed to prepare a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) detailing our entire recommended plan for you, and the take-up necessary to begin.

Next, a couple of other documents are sorted out, including a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Master Services Agreement (MSA) and the finalisation of the SOW – this is where invoicing typically begins.

From there, sit-back as we commence on getting to work on your organisation’s well-deserved Digital Transformation!
