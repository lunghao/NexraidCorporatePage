# Our Project Team
Every project comprises of a team of our experts, who specialise in different sectors in ensuring a smooth, safe deployment.

## Solutions Architect (SA)
SAs are responsible for leading the overall technical vision and implementation of your solution and corresponding architecture. With cross-domain expertise, they bridge the gap between business and technological terminologies, overseeing the project to completion.

## Release and QA Engineer (QA)
QAs are responsible for designing and deploying your solution. They set-up the appropriate pre-production and production environments, while testing and validating the stability of your solution to ensure proper deployment to production.

## Security and Compliance Advisor (SCA)
Security is our top priority. All solutions will have to be cleared by your SCA during the design phase, and both before and after deployment, ensuring the safety and security of your valuable data.

## DevOps Engineer
Our DevOps engineers have vast, senior experience with working on a wide array of cloud-native technologies. They are responsible for the hands-on implementation, deployment and orchestration of your infrastructure â€“ pairing heavily with your engineering team to get them informed on the complete technology stack.

## Software Engineer (SE)
SEs are trained by our Senior Engineers in Nexraid and have developed the technical knowledge to be able to develop secure and stable, production grade software.

## Network Engineer (NE)
NEs ensure that your systems stay well-connected together, by ensuring your environment has sufficient redundancy for the highest availability required for your services.

## System Administrator (SysAdmin)
SysAdmins manage all the configurations for your various systems, providing day-to-day operational monitoring and support, ensuring that you achieve the highest performance possible with little disruption.
