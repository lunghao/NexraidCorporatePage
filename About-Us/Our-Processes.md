# “Our Processes”

## Research & Discovery
1. We perform a comprehensive Technical Audit to inventory your entire stack to ensure we cover all your available components, external systems and backing services.
2. Following which, we conduct thorough interviews with your Stakeholders to learn your best-practices and uncover existing pain-points.
3. We then identify and codify all Technical & Business Requirements – from your financial motivations and departmental budgets to your project’s technical motivations for all-round success.
4. Finally, we review your existing design documentation, infrastructure and code repositories, to identify possible re-usability or necessary changes to ensure compatibility with an Public Cloud or Hybrid Cloud environment.

## Pilot
1. We work with you to fast-track a Proof-of-Concept (PoC), to demonstrate how the new system is intended to work, while giving your IT staff the platform to give early feedback.
2. Next, we prepare documentation of your architecture, including technical diagrams of the various components, network topology, enhanced entity-relationship (EER) diagrams and other visual aids to ensure clarity of the entire project.
3. Thereafter, we establish objective timelines to track delivery of milestones and the associated acceptance criteria for each milestone delivered.
4. By doing so, we provide transparency throughout the process – where 25% of our time is spent documenting, evaluating and assisting in your procurement decisions.

## Preparation
1. We adapt to your preferred flavour of “AGILE” and integrate ourselves into your existing project management systems (e.g. Azure DevOps or Atlassian Jira).
2. We aim for weekly smaller deliverables (“Small Wins”) to demonstrate and ensure continuous progress, recorded via git check-ins, status updates, and documentation.
3. Furthermore, we hold weekly or bi-weekly calls to review all open request and update you on the project's status, so that you stay well-informed.
4. Finally, we guide your IT staff whenever new issues occur, enabling them to perform better, while emphasising joint automation to prevent potentially disastrous afterthoughts.

## Deployment
1. We perform QA & Testing, Business Continuity Planning, regular Soft-Launches, and Disaster Recovery drills to keep everyone well-prepared.
2. Next, we roll out comprehensive Monitoring & Alerts for both internal and external systems, while defining the responsibilities for On-Call Engineers (OCE) and setup PagerDuty rotation – this establishes processes for communicating outages and conducting Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
3. After which, we conduct a final security audit, involving a full review of security groups, access controls, and key rotation – among other security policies.
4. Most importantly, we develop a comprehensive “Go-Live” Plan that addresses all tasks necessary for us to flip the switch to bring your system live, inclusive of contingencies for any unforeseen circumstances.
 
## Maintenance & Support
1. We stay engaged throughout even after the deployment, as part of our continuous investment in your business success, with an expert ready to assist an arm’s reach away.
2. We also assist with the life-cycle management of your infrastructure, assisting with upgrades, address bugs should they arise, and suggest improvements to your workflows as new technologies become available.
3. Furthermore, we perform periodic audits and reviews to ensure everything is in tip-top shape, while making sure your budget is well-kept with spending forecasts and cost control.
4. Lastly, we provide hand-off documentation and prepare GitHub + Markdown documentation on all your core deliverables, alongside any other requested areas too, to ensure you have the best knowledge on hand.
